/**
 * @brief Default parameter values
 *
 * Note on Multi-Byte Parameters: Parameter values are stored using the same
 * byte-order used in the HCI packets that send the items to the 9301. Except
 * as noted, this means the values are stored in Big-Endian order. This is
 * counter-intuitive given that the Bluetooth spec calls for Little-Endian
 * ordering, but it is the order used by the 9301 for communicating the the
 * EM6819. Byte reversals do occur where appropriate; the EM9301 is fully
 * compliant witht he Bluetooth standards.
 *
 * Note on deviceAddress: unlike the other items, device address is ordered in
 * little-endian fashion, LSB first. Thus the most significant byte is 0x0E and
 * bit 1 (the 2nd least-significant bit) of this address is set. This signifies
 * that its locally administered rather than a globally unique address. See the
 * Bluetooth 4.0 Core spec, Volume 6, part B, section 1.3 Device Address, the
 * IEEE 802-2001 standard and this Wikipedia article,
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Address_details.
 *
 * Also, see notes in params.h and CUSTOMIZATION.md.

/**
 * @brief Beacon Mode-Mask Rotation
 *
 * When multiple modes are selected there is a 20 ms minimum separation between
 * advertisements mandated by the 4.0 Core specifications. Instead of using a
 * wait operation, the modes are "rotated" each sleep/wake cycle via a changing
 * mask that selects just one of the advertising modes for that cycle.
 *
 * The changing masks form a repeating sequence. The basic idea is to
 * synthesize the sequence (in InitializeBeaconMaskRing) each time a new set
 * of masks is required by one of the state machines, storing the base
 * sequence in the 'maskRing' array. Then, each time we wake up, the next array
 * element is used (by applying the result of calling RotateModeMask), wrapping
 * back to the beginning in order to repeat.
